Okay, buddy, take a quick look, I'll show you how to use this bot ;P

First, the commands are:
$hello
$heh [number]
$check [Put the image]

$hello makes the bot say "hello"
$heh makes the bot repeat "heh" 10, 100, 1000 times
$check makes the bot analyze an image (banana, apple, airplane, dogs, cats, pigeons)

And that's it ;V
