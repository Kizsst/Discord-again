# Discord-again
Okay, buddy, take a quick look, I'll show you how to use this bot ;P

First, the commands are:
$hello
$heh [number]
$check [Put the image]

$hello makes the bot say "hello"
$heh makes the bot repeat "heh" 10, 100, 1000 times
$check makes the bot analyze an image (banana, apple, airplane, dogs, cats, pigeons)

And that's it ;V

OHHHHHHHHHHHHHH AND BTW, U NEED CREATE AN VIRTUALENV WITH PYTHON 3.11 (Preferably)

And install these libraries:
pipenv install discord.py keras tensorflow pillow numpy
(And when you're going to start the project, do it from a terminal with the following command: pipenv run python main.py)
keras_model.h5 and labels.txt must be in the same folder as main.py
Discord Bot Token and Google API Key (if using Gemini) must be configured in the code.

THAT'S IT BUDDY, TY FOR READING <33333333
